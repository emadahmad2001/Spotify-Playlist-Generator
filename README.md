# Spotify-Playlist-Generator

### Here's a simple Python program that uses the pytube library to extract the song name from a YouTube link, the ``SpeechRecognition`` library to analyze the song, and the spotipy library to find similar songs and create a playlist. Please note that you need to install these libraries first using pip:

``pip install pytube SpeechRecognition spotipy``

### This program takes a YouTube link as input, extracts the song name, analyzes the song using speech recognition, finds similar songs using Spotify, and creates a playlist. Please replace ``your-spotify-client-id`` and ``your-spotify-client-secre`` with your actual Spotify API credentials.

### Note: This program uses the ``SpeechRecognition`` library to analyze the song, but it's not clear how you want to use speech recognition to analyze the song. This program simply uses speech recognition to transcribe what the user says, but you may want to use it to analyze the audio of the song itself. Also, this program uses the spotipy library to find similar songs, but you may want to use a different method to find similar songs.
